# BrightnessControl

Tiny tray icon app enabling you to control brightness of your screen. Ideal for desktops while working at night when the only option to control the brightness is to use the buttons on the monitor. The monitor must have DDC protocol enabled (most modern monitors have).

With the latest version you can adjust the brightness just by scrolling with your mouse hovered over the icon, just like adjusting audio volume in Win 11.
